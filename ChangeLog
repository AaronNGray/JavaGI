	* release 0.7.0
	* Support for use of 'super' inside implementation definitions
	  with a super implementation definition
	* Support for abstract methods in implementations	
          (Because of time pressure, I did not implement support for
	   implementations of multi-headed interfaces.It should be,
	   however, only a matter of coding to add support for abstract
	   methods in implementations of multi-headed interfaces.)
	* Support for omission of empty receivers
	* Fixed soundness bug for wildcards

2006-07-27 Stefan Wehr
	* release 0.6.0
	* Wf-Prog-9 is now part of the downward-closed well-formedness criterion,
	  Wf-Prog-10 thus became Wf-Prog-9
	* Bugfixes
	
2009-06-19 Stefan Wehr
	* release 0.5.0

	* support for ignoring certain implementations at runtime
	* dropped support for implementation definitions with constraints on interfaces
	  with static methods
	* fixed covariant return type bug
